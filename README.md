Credit goes to jjolano for making this tweak. 

This REPO only seems to work in Zebra as Cydia always gives hashsum mismatch. Not sure why but it does. Please add this in Zebra for it to work or manually download the .deb file and install it yourself.

This is only to host the modded version of Shadow nothing more this works with iOS 12.4. NO support will be given by myself as I did not modify it or create it I have simply shared it with others to use.

I have used this without any issues on the iPhone 8 running iOS 12.4 with unc0ver and it works perfectly fine even with Mario Kart Tour.
